# HAL for working with atsamc devices

This crate provides a type-safe API for working with atsamc21 based devices.
Currently this crate supports `atsamc21n18a`
(selectable via the `samc21n18a` features),
and should be able to support other variants in a similar fashion; 
pull requests for this are welcomed!
